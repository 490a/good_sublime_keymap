Good Sublime Keymap

Introduction:
This keymap is based upon by https://github.com/bohdon/sublimeAlternateVIMNavigation, with some additions and slight changes.This current version is not really for everyone, as it involves a rehaul of even 'ctrl+o' so it no longer opens files. (not a big deal for me since ctrl+p is all i use)

*Warning*
This keymap replaces most of the default sublime shortcuts for i,j,k,l,u&o.  For me and I suspect some others, navigation takes a priority to most other shortcuts


To Install:
Preferences > Key Bindings - Default
   copy and paste into the file that's opened, and remove conflicting keymaps through a quick search
